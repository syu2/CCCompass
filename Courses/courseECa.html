<br>Provides perspective for thinking about the future through the study of historical physical science and historically significant experiments. Designed to build awareness of the unexpected through both observation of the sky and lab activities that focus on light, electricity, and motion. Labs are complemented by museum and site visits; readings include accounts by Galileo, Archimedes, and other historical observers. Individual and team assignments provide opportunities to develop skills in observation, exploration, and evaluation. Students must keep an observing notebook and write a reflective paper; students taking the graduate version complete additional assignments.

Follows the history of successful MIT spin-off companies with attention to the people (and their ideas) behind the start-up. Students attend MIT technology and science start-up case presentations given by individuals and teams working from zero-stage, and by partners in going concerns of historical relevance to the Institute and the economy.  Second in a two-part series (seminars do not have to be taken sequentially; see EC.074 in fall term).
