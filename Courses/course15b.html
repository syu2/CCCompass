<br>Course spans the entire two-year Leaders for Global Operations (LGO) program, with a focus on leadership that blends theory and practice. During their first summer in the program, students reflect on exemplary leaders' stories in cases, the arts, journalism, philosophy, and social science, and evaluate their own previous leadership experience.  During the succeeding four semesters, they apply the lessons they have learned in class to their off-campus internship and other activities at Sloan, and intensively review that experience as they reach the end of the program.  Classes take the form of moderated discussion, with the expectation that students will participate fully in each session; students also submit short, written deliverables throughout the program.
