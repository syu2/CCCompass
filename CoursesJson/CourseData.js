Students complete a 10-12 week internship, which includes filing three progress reports, conducting one informational interview, and possibly hosting a site visit by MIT staff.  Returning to campus as juniors, UPOP students take part in reflective exercises that aid assimilation of learning objectives and reinforce the cognitive link between all aspects of the UPOP experience and disciplinary fields of study.

Focus on methodology, i.e., the theory and analysis of how research should proceed. Special attention to epistemological issues--pre-suppositions about the nature of knowledge. What makes research distinctively feminist lies in the complex connections between epistemologies, methodologies and research methods.

Students complete a 10-12 week internship, which includes filing three progress reports, conducting one informational interview, and possibly hosting a site visit by MIT staff.  Returning to campus as juniors, UPOP students take part in reflective exercises that aid assimilation of learning objectives and reinforce the cognitive link between all aspects of the UPOP experience and disciplinary fields of study.

The program has a dual focus: it gives students an introduction to the MIT experience by exposing them to the rigors of a full subject load while simultaneously preparing them for academic success beyond MIT. The program includes calculus; chemistry; physical education;  physics; writing, oral presentation and teamwork skills; and supporting academic activities, including small-group learning. Students can earn transcript credit for subjects taken in the program, sometimes resulting in advanced placement in corresponding subjects taken in the Fall. Activities include day trips to area cultural, recreational, and business sites. Students participate in a range of personal and educational development seminars and activities designed to ensure their smooth transition to college life.",
